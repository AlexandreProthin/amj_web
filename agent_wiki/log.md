# Wiki Update Log

## 2026-09-15

* **Initialization**: Created the bundle as an Open Knowledge Format v0.2 tree —
  `architecture/`, `components/`, `specs/`, `decisions/`, `plans/`, `issues/`,
  `computations/`, `references/` — each with an `index.md`, plus this log.
* **Creation**: Wrote the [maintenance protocol](/references/wiki-protocol.md),
  which defines roles, where concepts go, naming, linking, and lifecycle.
* **Creation**: Wrote [the OKF reference](/references/okf-spec.md) recording
  which parts of the spec this wiki leans on, and noting that the canonical
  spec has moved to its own repository.
* **Creation**: Added [okf.py](/references/tools/okf-tool.md), the validator and
  offline visualizer, adapted from Google's Apache-2.0 reference agent.
* **Creation**: Added the [wiki conformance
  computation](/computations/wiki-conformance.md) with its
  [executor](/references/skills/run-command.md) and
  [attester](/references/attesters/index.md), so "the wiki is valid" is a
  checkable claim rather than an assertion.
* **Planning**: Added the [GitHub-hosted static web
  page](/plans/github-pages-static-site.md) plan, recording the confirmed
  hosting and QR-code constraints and the decisions still needed.
